The second of two projects that introduced networking was this one. As I practised modifying IP addresses with Bash scripts, I gained more knowledge about IP addresses.

Tasks:

- Task 0 - Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements.<br>
Requirements:
	- localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
	- facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.

- Task 1 - Write a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine itâ€™s executed on.

- Task 2 - write Bash script that listens on port 98 on localhost.
